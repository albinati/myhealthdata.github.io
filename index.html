    <h1>MY HEALTH DATA MANIFESTO</h1>
    <h2>CONNECTING PEOPLE, IMPROVING HEALTH</h2>
    <p>The main purpose of technologies is to improve human life and the environment around us. However, the society insists on segmenting classes and, 
        by the manipulation of the resources scarcity, which should be abundant, 
        limit the individual and collective rights and freedoms, and, as consequence, 
        we are faced with the reduction in the life quality and the perspectives of the future of populations.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to reverse this logic and offer unrestricted access to health in an abundant, democratic and inclusive way, 
        we would like to offer to the society a technological tool capable of generating abundance of health resources, 
        where the individual and his relation and interaction with the other, society and nature will be able to provide concrete solutions to a healthy life.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using the Blockchain technology, we invite everyone, through our interactions, to create a health data network, 
        in which we will be the agents capable of generating solutions, which bases should be:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Empowerment of people, where the individual is not the patient, but the agent, the generator and the owner of their information;</li>
        <li>User centralized data generation capable of providing the network with reliable and faithful information;</li>
        <li>Generation and transmission of consistent information, capable of assisting in medical, pharmaceutical and wellness research and remunerating the parties involved;</li>
        <li>Creation of an "anti-fragile" system, supported by multiple nodes of the network, encryption, anonymity and database not corruptible and, 
            at the same time, generic capable of adapting to multiple situations, people and cultures easily;</li>
        <li>
            User-focused solution, in which the Individuals will always be at the forefront of institutions, whether they are governments or for-profit entities.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        In short, the agentes information flows will be able to produce, transmit and generate the social capital of a health built by all.
