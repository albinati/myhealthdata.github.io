# MY HEALTH DATA MANIFESTO

## CONNECTING PEOPLE, IMPROVING HEALTH

We understand that the various technologies developed have as their main purpose to improve and facilitate the lives of people and the world around them. It is natural that as we evolve technologically, past ways of solving some problems become obsolete and new solutions emerge. Human health is the most valuable asset in the world that impacts consumption, income generation and all the dynamism of any world politics.

This manifesto invites to bring the individual as a central point of attention and with the purpose of generating significant value for what is tangible and intangible in human nature. To do so, using a data network distributed and granted by the owner of the information, it is intended to create a new ecosystem with the following premises:

1. Give control and ownership of information to the owner of the information, rather than delegating to an intermediary;
2. Unify and centralize information in a single identity, rather than fragmented into different systems and databases;
3. Generate value for the information and for the individual, instead of working with massification of data without value;
4. Ensure traceability with origin, destination and use of information, rather than indiscriminate and unsecured use of information.

Thus, we aim as a consequence the unrestricted, abundant, democratic and inclusive offer so that all individuals can use in any way necessary for the maintenance and improvement of both their own health and derived activities.
